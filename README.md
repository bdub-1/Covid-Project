# Covid-Project
Here is a 2-part project I completed. 

Part 1 began with pulling an excel file from Owid.com about covid.  I imported the data into SQL and Explored the data.

Part 2 began with me exporting data tables from SQL into Tableau for vizualization where I created a dashboard
(Part 2 is on Tableau Public)
